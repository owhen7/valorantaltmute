<h3 align="center">Valorant Alt-Mute</h3>

  <p align="center">
    In CS:GO, when you alt-tab out of the game to watch youtube videos after you entry-frag and die, the game and the voice chat is muted. In Valorant, that's not the case automatically. This executable fixes that.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Hey this is just a simple project I made that mutes Valorant when it isn't your foreground full-screen application and unmutes it once you alt-tab back in. It will mute both your teammates talking and the game sound. This program won't work if you don't play VALORANT full-screen.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
It's just a single .exe file. Just run the file. It will open up a terminal window that will mute valorant when the game alt-tabbed. Close the terminal window when you are done playing.
### Prerequisites

You need a windows machine to run this script, but you also need one to play VALORANT.

### Installation

1. Optionally, read the source code here to verify the integrity of the .exe file.
2. Download the .exe file from this GitHub page.
3. Run the executable before or during your VALORANT match.
